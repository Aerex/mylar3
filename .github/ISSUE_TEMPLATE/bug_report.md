**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**CarePackage**
On the config page, there is a button labelled "CarePackage". Pressing this button will download a zip file containing a redacted copy of your config, your database, a summary of your operating environment, and your logs. Upload that file here.

If you're uncomfortable with pasting your CarePackage, include a DEBUG log containing the error from disk. 

Do not paste from the GUI log.
Do not just paste a traceback/error.


**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. Windows10]
 - Branch / commit: [e.g. Dev/38aksi1]
